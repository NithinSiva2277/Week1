# Week1
Preprocessing pipeline for water pollution monitoring project (AICTE Week 1). Includes dataset cleaning, balancing, and preparation for machine learning models.


**Problem Statement**
Access to safe drinking water is still a challenge worldwide. Contaminated water causes serious health issues. This project uses data Machine Learning to analyze water quality and predict if water is potable or not.
This work supports SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation, promoting safe and sustainable water management through technology.

**Preprocessing Steps**

**Collect & Import Data** – Used Kaggle dataset with water quality parameters.

**Clean Data** – Handle missing values and inconsistencies. 

**Scale Features** – Normalize values for fair comparison.

**Balance Data (SMOTE)** – Avoid bias by balancing potable/non-potable samples.

**Split Features & Labels** – Inputs: water parameters; Output: potability.

**Train-Test Split** – Prepare for model building and evaluation.

**Expected Outcome**
A ready-to-use dataset for ML models to predict water safety and highlight key factors, contributing to sustainable water solutions.
